WITH RESPECT TO THIS ASSIGNMENT.

THIS IS THE README FILE FOR PROJECT 2.

Student Name: Harikeshav Rameshkumar
Time taken: 3 hours

The use of bitwise operations (XOR, rotations) in this project is a good demonstration of how low-level
operations can be used to manipulate and decrypt data. It shows the importance of binary manipulation
in cryptography.

First, I used the `break 97` command to place a break point at line 97. Then, I used the `print/x key`
command to print the key in hexadecimal. Then i used the `continue` command to step through the program
and see how the value of the `key` variable was changing.

Key entered: 10101010
