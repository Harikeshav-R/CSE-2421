Program Description:
This program decrypts a sequence of hexadecimal characters using an 8-bit key.
The user first provides a key as a sequence of 0s and 1s, which is used to
determine the decryption key. The encrypted text is then entered in hexadecimal
format, and the program decrypts and outputs the corresponding plain text.

Overall Method:
1. Read and construct the 8-bit decryption key from binary input.
2. Continuously read encrypted characters in hexadecimal form.
3. Decrypt each character by applying alternating bit rotations and an XOR with
   the decryption key.
4. Print the decrypted message to the console.
